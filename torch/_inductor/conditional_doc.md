Creates a conditional operation (torch.cond) in the IR. Takes a predicate tensor,
true/false subgraphs, and operands, then constructs IR nodes to execute the appropriate
branch. Ensures outputs from both branches are structurally equivalent (same device,
dtype, layout). Returns a list of MultiOutput tensors.
